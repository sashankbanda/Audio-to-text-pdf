# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

🔹 Changes & Improvements in app.py
✅ Added CORS Support → CORS(app), allowing frontend access.
✅ Improved File Handling → Removes unnecessary template rendering (React handles UI).
✅ API Endpoints Return JSON → Better API design for React.
✅ Real-time Progress Updates → /progress endpoint for live status tracking.
✅ Port 5000 → Explicitly defined for better cross-origin handling with React (localhost:3000).

🔹 Updates & Fixes in App.js
✅ Connected to Flask API (localhost:5000/upload) for real file upload.
✅ Added real-time progress updates using Server-Sent Events (/progress).
✅ Displays actual transcription from the backend.
✅ Improved UI feedback with better state management.

🔹 Key Features
✔ Uploads audio to Flask backend (/upload).
✔ Displays real-time progress updates using Server-Sent Events (SSE) from /progress.
✔ Handles backend responses and updates UI dynamically.
✔ Uses axios for HTTP requests and efficient progress tracking.
✔ Improved UI feedback with a preformatted block (<pre>) for better readability.

🔹 Next Steps
Ensure Flask backend (app.py) is running on localhost:5000 before testing.
Install axios in React:
npm install axios
Run React app:
npm start
