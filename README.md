## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally from the root directory.

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following software installed on your machine:
- **Python** (3.8 or higher)
- **Node.js** (14.x or higher) and **npm**

### Setup Instructions
All commands should be run from the project's root directory.

1.  **Install Backend Dependencies:**
    - Create and activate a Python virtual environment (recommended):
    ```sh
    # For Windows
    python -m venv venv
    venv\Scripts\activate

    # For macOS/Linux
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
    - Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    pip install fpdf flask-cors
    ```

2.  **Install Frontend Dependencies:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

## ▶️ How to Run

You will need **two separate terminals** running in the project's root directory.

1.  **Terminal 1: Start the Flask Backend**
    - Make sure your Python virtual environment is activated.
    - Run the Flask app:
    ```sh
    python app.py
    ```
    - The backend will be running at `http://localhost:5000`.

2.  **Terminal 2: Start the React Frontend**
    - Open a new terminal in the same root directory.
    - Run the React app:
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```
    - The frontend will open automatically in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

3.  **Use the App:**
    - Open `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.
    - Upload an audio file and see the transcription process in real-time.

## 📡 API Endpoints
| Method | Endpoint               | Description                                |
| :----- | :--------------------- | :----------------------------------------- |
| `POST` | `/upload`              | Uploads an audio file for transcription.   |
| `GET`  | `/progress`            | Streams real-time progress updates via SSE.|
| `GET`  | `/download/<filename>` | Downloads the final transcription as a PDF.|

## 🤔 Troubleshooting

- **CORS Errors:** Ensure `flask-cors` is installed (`pip install flask-cors`) and correctly initialized in `app.py`. The provided code already handles this.
- **Flask Server Not Starting:** Make sure all dependencies in `requirements.txt` are installed in your active virtual environment.
- **React App Fails to Start:** Delete the `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json` file, then run `npm install` again from the root directory.
- **Large File Issues:** The Whisper model may take a long time to process very large audio files. For production, consider a more robust setup with background workers (e.g., Celery).
